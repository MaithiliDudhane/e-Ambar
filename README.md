This is my first GitHub repository. <br>
  'Ambar' is our college magazine, and e-Ambar was created to read and manage the content shared by students and others. To get started with this project, begin by reviewing the 'e-Ambar.html' file. This file serves as the main entry point and links to all other related files within the project.</p>
